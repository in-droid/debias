*   **The Controversial Study (1998):** Was a case series detailing the clinical findings and histories of 12 children who regressed into autistic spectrum disorders, particularly focusing on their bowel symptoms.
*   **Parental Reports:** Eight of the 12 parents reported their child's regression followed the MMR vaccine; the study reported this history as told by the parents.
*   **Study's Stated Limitation:** Explicitly stated it did *not* prove an association or causal link between the MMR vaccine and the disorder.
*   **Study's Conclusion:** Identified a potentially new bowel disease in children with autism, suggested it might be related to their developmental regression (occurring around the same time), and stated the parent-reported association with MMR needed thorough investigation.
*   **Researcher's Later Recommendation:** Based on a subsequent review of vaccine safety literature, the researcher could no longer support the combined MMR vaccine due to inadequate safety studies, instead recommending single, spaced-out vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella given separately).
*   **Government Role in Vaccine Uptake:** Claims the UK government withdrew the availability of single vaccines, forcing parents concerned about MMR into an "MMR or no way" choice, which the researcher blames for the subsequent fall-off in vaccination rates.
*   **Co-author Retraction:** States co-authors retracted an *interpretation* (that MMR caused autism â€“ which the study didn't claim) but did *not* retract the actual scientific findings of the paper. Calls the retraction unfortunate and misused.
*   **Allegations of Discrediting:** Acknowledges being targeted for discrediting and compares these tactics to internal Merck documents discussing how to handle doctors critical of Vioxx (e.g., "isolate them," "discredit them," "destroy them"). Argues this is "corporate policy."
*   **Denial of Conflict of Interest:** Asserts there was no conflict of interest regarding the Lancet study; specifically denies it was funded by the Legal Aid Board and states Lancet disclosure rules were followed.
*   **Denial of Data Fudging:** Calls allegations of data fudging "entirely false" and attributes them to a specific journalist. States no such charges have been brought forward during the extensive General Medical Council hearing.
