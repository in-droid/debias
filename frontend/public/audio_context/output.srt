1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So if you look at that, China, first row,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
China, 67 percent. That's tariffs charged to the USA, including currency

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
manipulation and trade barriers. So 67 percent. I think you can, for the most

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
part, see it. Those with good eyes, with bad eyes. We didn't want to bring — it's

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
very windy out here — we didn't want to bring out the big charts because it had

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
no chance of standing. Fortunately, we came armed with a little smaller chart.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So 67 percent. So we're going to be charging a discounted reciprocal tariff

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
of 34 percent. I think, in other words, they charge us, we charge them, we charge

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
them less. So how can anybody be upset? They will be, because we never charge

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
anybody anything. But now we're going to charge. European Union, they're very tough,

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
very, very tough traders. You know, you think of

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,000
China, they're very tough. They're very tough. They're very tough. They're very tough.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
European Union, very friendly. They rip us off. It's so sad to see. It's so

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
pathetic. 39 percent. We're going to charge them 20 percent. So we're charging

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
them essentially half. Vietnam, great negotiators, great people. They like me. I

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
like them. The problem is they charge us 90 percent. We're going to charge them 46

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
percent tariff. Taiwan, where they make — they took all of our computer chips and

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
semiconductors. We used to be the king, right? We were —

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
we were everything. We had all of it. Now we have almost none of it, except the biggest

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
company is coming in. They're going to have — we're going to end up with almost 40 percent.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Lee Zeldin is working to get their approvals. And it's an amazing company. Mr. Wei of

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
one of the great companies of the world, actually. They're coming in from Taiwan, and they're

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
going to build one of the biggest plants in the world, maybe the biggest for that. But

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
64 percent, we're going to charge them 32 percent. Japan, very, very tough. Great people.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And, again, I don't blame the people for doing it. It's — I think they're very smart

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
at doing it. I blame the people that sat right in that Oval Office right over there, right

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
behind the Resolute desk or whichever desk they chose. Japan, 46 percent. They would

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
charge us 46 percent, and much higher for certain items, like cars — you know, little

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
items like cars. 46 percent, we're charging them 24 percent. India, very, very tough.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Very, very tough. The Prime Minister just left.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And he's a great friend of mine. But I said, you're a friend of mine, but you're not treating

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
us right. They charged us 52 percent. You have to understand, we charge them almost

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
nothing for years and years and decades. And it was only seven years ago, when I came in,

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
we started with China and charged them — we took in hundreds of billions of dollars from

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
China in tariffs. And they understood, honestly. President Xi understood. He said, look, I

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
understand. And the other countries — and they all understand.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We're going to have to go through a little tough love, maybe. But they all understand.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
They're ripping us off, and they understood it.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo, was Shinzo Abe. He was a fantastic man. He was unfortunately

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
taken from us — assassination. But I went to him and I said, Shinzo, we have to do something.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
A trade is not fair. And he said, I know that. I know that. And he was a great gentleman.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He was a fantastic man. But he understood immediately what I was talking about. I said,

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Shinzo, we have to do something. He said, I know that. And we worked out a deal. And

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
it would have been a much better deal. But, frankly, there were many years left in the

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
deal that was made previous to my getting there. But it was — it was something.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
If you look at Switzerland, 61 percent to 31 percent. Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
— oh, look at Cambodia, 97 percent.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We're going to bring it down.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The Press, too.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The President, too.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
President Trump, they're going to bring it down to 40 percent. And they made a fortune

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
with the United States of America.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
United Kingdom, 10 percent! And we'll go 10 percent. So we'll do the same thing.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
South Africa, oh, 60 percent, 30 percent. And they've got some bad things going on in

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
South Africa.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You know, we're paying them billions of dollars. We cut the funding because a lot of bad things

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
are happening in South Africa. The fake news ought to be looking at it. They don't want

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
to report it.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Brazil, 10 percent, 10 percent.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The President of the United States,

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
President Trump, and the United States.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They are very, very tough.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Very, very tough.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The Prime Minister just left, and he's a great

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
friend of mine, but I said, you're a friend of mine,

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
but you're not treating us right.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
They charged us 52 percent.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You have to understand, we charge them almost

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
nothing, for years and years and decades.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And it was only seven years ago when I came in,

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
we started with China in charge, and we took in

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
hundreds of billions of dollars from China in

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
tariffs, and they understood, honestly.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
President Xi understood.

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He said, look, I understand.

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And the other countries, and they all understand.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We're going to have to go through a little tough

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
love, maybe, but they all understand.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
They're ripping us off, and they understood it.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo, was Shinzo Abe.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He was a fantastic man.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He was, unfortunately, taken from us.

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Assassination.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But I went to him and I said, Shinzo,

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
we have to do something.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
A trade is not fair.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And he said, I know that.

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I know that.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And he was a great gentleman.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He was a fantastic man.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But he understood immediately what I was

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
talking about.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I said, Shinzo, we have to do something.

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He said, I know that.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And we worked out a deal.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And it would have been a much better deal, but,

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
frankly, there were many years left in the deal

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
that was made previous to my getting there.

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But it was something.

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If you look at Switzerland, 61 percent

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
to 31 percent.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia.

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh, look at Cambodia, 97 percent.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We're going to bring it down to 49.

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
They made a fortune with the United States of America.

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
United Kingdom, 10 percent.

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And we'll go 10 percent.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So we'll do the same thing.

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
South Africa, oh, 60 percent, 30 percent.

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And they've got some bad things going on in South Africa.

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You know, we're paying them billions of dollars,

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and we cut the funding because a lot of bad things.

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The President, the United States slashed our trade

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
barriers on other countries, while those nations placed

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
massive tariffs on our products and created

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
outrageous non-monetary barriers to decimate our

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
industries.

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And in many cases, the non-monetary barriers were

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
worse than the monetary ones.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
They manipulated their currencies, subsidized

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
their exports, stole our intellectual property,

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
imposed exorbitant VAT taxes to disadvantage our

123
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
products.

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Adopted unfair rules and technical standards, and

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
created filthy pollution havens.

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
They were absolutely filthy, but they always

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
came to us and they said, we're violating.

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We should pay for it.

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's all detailed in a very big report by the U.S.

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Trade Representative on Foreign Trade Barriers.

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And I'll just hold it up for you.

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's available, and you don't have to pay too much.

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
As I understand it, you'll pay nothing.

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's a lot of work, a lot of work for something.

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Actually, because it's a special book.

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's very, frankly, it's very upsetting when you

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
read it, when you see what people have been doing to

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
us for 30 years.

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This all happened with no response from the United

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
States of America, none whatsoever.

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But those days are over.

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Let me offer just a few examples of the vicious

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
attacks our workers have faced for so many years.

144
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The United States charges other countries only a

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
2.4 billion dollars.

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's a lot of money.

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's a lot of money.

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And the United States charges a 2.4 billion

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
dollars more tariff on motorcycles.

150
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Meanwhile, Thailand and others are charging much

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
higher prices, like 60 percent.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
India charges 70 percent.

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Vietnam charges 75 percent.

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And others are even higher than that.

155
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Likewise, until today, the United States has, for

156
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
decades, charged a 2.5 tariff.

157
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Think of that, 2.5 percent on foreign-made

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
automobiles.

159
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The European Union charges us more than the

160
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
United States does.

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So, in the United States, they charge an even

162
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
10 percent tariff and they have 20 percent VATS.

163
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Much, much higher.

164
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
India charges 70 percent, or perhaps worst of all

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
are the nonmonetary restrictions imposed by

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
South Korea, Japan, and very many other nations,

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
as a result of these colossal trade barriers.

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Eighty-one percent of the cars in South Korea are

169
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
made in South Korea.

170
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Ninety-four percent of the cars in Japan are made in

171
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Japan.

172
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Toyota sells 1.1 billion dollars.

173
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
1 million foreign-made automobiles into the

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
United States, and General Motors sells almost none.

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Ford sells very little.

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
None of our companies are allowed to go into other

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
countries.

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And I say that friend and foe, and in many cases,

179
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
the friend is worse than the foe in terms of trade.

180
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But such horrendous imbalances have

181
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
devastated our industrial base and put our national

182
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
security at risk.

183
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't blame these other countries at all for this

184
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
calamity.

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I blame former presidents and past leaders who

186
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
weren't doing their job.

187
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
They let it happen, and they let it happen to an

188
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
extent that nobody can even believe.

189
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's why, effective at midnight, we will impose a

190
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
25 percent tariff on all foreign-made automobiles.

191
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Thank you.

192
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Brian, I'd like to have you come up here for a second.

193
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay?

194
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I just see him sitting.

195
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
He's been a fan of ours.

196
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Thank you.

197
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And he understands this business a lot better than

198
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
the economists, a lot better than anybody.

199
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Brian, say a few words, please, would you?

200
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Thank you, Mr. President.

201
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's a great honor to have you.

202
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Thanks.

203
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Thank you, Mr. President.

204
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I grew up just north of Detroit, Michigan, in

205
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Macomb County, known as the home of the Reagan Democrats.

206
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
My first vote for President Obama was in
