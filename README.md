# Problem
    In today’s world, we often need to stay cautious while watching YouTube videos.  
    Frequently, these videos present opinions and information as absolute truth, even though they may be inaccurate or heavily influenced by left- or right-leaning political perspectives.
# Solution
    DebiasIT analyzes YouTube videos by extracting audio, transcribing it, and using LLMs to estimate political bias with reasoning and fact-check key claims using web sources. It outputs a summary, bias analysis, and verified fact-checks.
